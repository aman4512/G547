Assignment 1

Usage:

The module gives values for 3 accelerometer axes. The required axis can be passed as a command line parameter.
Example:

`sudo ./adxl.o -x` (Replace `adxl.o` with name of object file generated)

will give x axis value output.

`sudo ./adxl.o -xyz`

will give values for all three axes.
Similarly any two axes acan also be queried.
